# DCS Waypoint Exporter

This tool is written in C#, and can import/export waypoints from the new route planning tool of DCS.

The exported route can be distributed via file or as an encoded string, that could be shared by TeamSpeak.

## Known issues
1. ***MAPS:*** We tried to get all map names right. But as we don't own all of them, there might be some issues. Let me know if some maps show no mission data.

2. ***Installer***: I know, we are still missing a good old installer.

3. For sure there are other things that we missed...
