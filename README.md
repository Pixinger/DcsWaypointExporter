# DCS Waypoint Exporter

*WARNING* Still in development. No official release available.

*Use at your own risk*

This tool is written in C#, and can import/export waypoints from the new route planning tool of DCS.

The exported route can be distributed via file or as an encoded string, that could be shared by TeamSpeak.

## Known issues
1. **MAPS:** As I don't own all maps, some names for the related configuration files, are still missing. If you some of them, please let me know.
1. **Installer**: I know, we are still missing a good old installer.
